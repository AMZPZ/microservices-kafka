## Choose Your Architecture

This project has 3 different architectures you can run:

### üèÉ Fastest Way to Run

#### Option 1: Monolithic (Simplest)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd 1-without-microservices/backend
npm install
node index.js

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd 1-without-microservices/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then visit: http://localhost:3000

---

#### Option 2: Microservices with Single Kafka (Recommended)
```bash
# Run this one command:
./start-all.sh 2

# Wait about 60 seconds for everything to start
# Then visit: http://localhost:3000
```

To stop:
```bash
./stop-all.sh
```

---

#### Option 3: Microservices with Kafka Cluster (Production-like)
```bash
# Run this one command:
./start-all.sh 3

# Wait about 60 seconds for everything to start
# Then visit: http://localhost:3000
```

To stop:
```bash
./stop-all.sh
```
